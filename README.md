Worked in a group of three to build a simple neural network structure with the task of labeling a dataset of images as a "cat" or a "dog". 
Using this framework we tested different activation functions and function parameters and graphed network performance in a loss vs. epochs graph to determine the performance of each set of parameters over time. 
The code was originally written in google Collab and imported to GitHub
