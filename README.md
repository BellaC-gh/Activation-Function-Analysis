Worked in a group of three to build a simple neural network structure with the task of labeling a dataset of images as a "cat" or a "dog". 
Using this framework we tested different activation functions and function paramters and graphed network preformance in a loss vs. epochs graph to determine the preformance of each set of parameters over time. 
The code was origionally written in google collab and imported to github
